GCD: |
  Refers to a button that invokes the global cooldown. Weaponskills are always on the global cooldown. There are also certain abilities that trigger the global cooldown, like [a:7497] or [a:7418]. Such abilities have the following text in their tooltip: "Triggers the cooldown of weaponskills upon execution. Cannot be executed during the cooldown of weaponskills."
ghosting: |
  "GCD ghosting" is an effect whereby, after pressing one of your buttons, your character begins the animation for that weaponskill, ability, or spell, but then cancels it as the server rejects the button input. This can happen for a variety of reasons, the most common being enemies moving out of range (especially during a dungeon pull), enemies (particularly large bosses) moving directly through your character, and so on. It points at a mismatch between where the server believes you and the enemies are, and where you are on your screen. Good ping can mitigate this effect.
AoE: Refers to an area of effect attack, i.e. an attack that can hit multiple enemies or players if they are too close to the target.
HoT: A status effect that heals over time. One healing tick happens approximately every three seconds.
DoT: A status effect that deals damage over time. One damage tick happens approximately every three seconds.
protean: |
  "Protean positions", also known as "clock spots", require all players to be spread out evenly around the boss.
  Named after Living Liquid's eponymous attack, [a:3829].

knockback circle: A knockback circle is a telegraphed circle that is pulsing purple. Being inside the circle when it resolves results in lethal damage; being outside of it knocks players away from the circle. It is generally recommended to be just on the outside of the circle to avoid being knocked outside of the arena.
color partners: A common strategy whereby markers are placed on each cardinal and intercard (generally with two adjacent markers being the same color), then assigns each marker to a player. The two players that share a marker color are considered partners for any mechanic that requires a partner stack.
stores: If a mechanic is "stored", it isn't executed immediately but is instead executed at some arbitrary point in the future, after other mechanics have been executed first.
body check: A type of mechanic that immediately follows another mechanic and is meant to punish parties that did not resolve the first mechanic cleanly (that is, without deaths), as all players are required to be alive to resolve this mechanic cleanly. If some players are dead, it may inevitably result in either more players dying, or the entire party wiping.
tankswap: A strategy whereby the two tanks "swap" their enmity values. The main tank becomes the off-tank and vice-versa. Generally accomplished via the off-tank using [a:7533] and, optionally, the main tank using [a:7537] afterwards.
max melee: The maximum distance outside an enemy's hitbox at which melee GCDs can still be used on the enemy.
kitchen sink: Refers to a tank using all of their defensive cooldowns (except invulnerability) on one attack to drastically reduce damage taken.
invuln: The action of using a tank invulnerability such as [a:30] or [a:43] to survive an attack.
true north: Not to be confused with the player action [a:7546], when a mechanic is handled "true north," this means that all player positions during the mechanic are relative to the north of the arena (and therefore the waymarkers that were placed down). Contrast [t:boss relative] strategies, where player positions are relative to the direction the boss is facing.
boss relative: When a mechanic is handled "boss relative," all positions are relative to the direction the boss is facing. This means that you should ignore the waymarkers and instead focus on the boss's hitbox. Contrast [t:true north] strategies, where player positions are relative to the absolute north of the arena.
collapse: When multiple players "collapse" onto each other, this means they stack right on top of each other for subsequent mechanics or movement.

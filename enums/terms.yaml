__meta_typename__: terms
GCD: "Refers to a button that invokes the global cooldown. Weaponskills are always on the global cooldown. There are also certain abilities that trigger the global cooldown, like [a:7497] or [a:7418]. Such abilities have the following text in their tooltip: \"Triggers the cooldown of weaponskills upon execution. Cannot be executed during the cooldown of weaponskills.\""
ghosting: \"GCD ghosting" is an effect whereby, after pressing one of your buttons, your character begins the animation for that weaponskill, ability, or spell, but then cancels it as the server rejects the button input. This can happen for a variety of reasons, the most common being enemies moving out of range (especially during a dungeon pull), enemies (particularly large bosses) moving directly through your character, and so on. It points at a mismatch between where the server believes you and the enemies are, and where you are on your screen. Good ping can mitigate this effect.
AoE: Refers to an area of effect attack, i.e. an attack that can hit multiple enemies or players if they are too close to the target.
enrage: Refers to an attack that instantly and unavoidably kills all players. The party must kill the enemy before this attack goes off or the fight restarts.

      Glowing lights travel across lines on the floor and eventually settle on one of 9 possible locations, where they will then emit a large [ms:chariot] explosion that inflicts [s:vuln].
      This then repeats, with all subsequent lights settling on all the spots that were *not* already hit.
      The possible locations are the cardinals, intercardinals, and the center of the arena.
      There are a limited number of patterns. At least one of the front spots (within [boss]'s hitbox) is safe on either iteration.
    resolve: Find a safe spot close to [boss], wait, then go to where an explosion just happened.

      Two towers appear that must both be soaked with as many party members as possible.
      The first tower always appears in the southeast of the arena, the second tower in the northwest.
      When the towers resolve, massive fireballs come down on the tower, sink halfway into the floor, and then stay there. Players must exit the fireball immediately or suffer continuous damage from [a:scald].
    resolve: Due to the locations of the towers it makes the most sense to place tanks and melees in the northwest tower and healers and ranged DPS in the southeast tower, so melees can maintain uptime.

    resolve: Spread out while avoiding AoEs. Try to give healers space in the middle of the arena to allow them to heal and mitigate the heavy raidwide that follows.

  void-meteor:
    id: 35671
    mechanic: mech
    description: |
      Calls down 14 [comets](t:comet) onto the arena, each dealing proximity damage, and starts the next major mechanic.
      The positions of the comets are fixed, with small variations. 11 of them will always come down in the front of the arena, rendering that entire hitbox unsafe. The remaining 3 comets are placed on the far east, far west, and far south of the arena.
      Next, a Dalamud symbol appears next to the southern comet, and 4 [distance tethers](mt:mech.tether.distance) attach themselves to 4 players as [boss] begins to cast [a:meteor-impact-cast]. Additionally, each tether has a blue rounded rectangle underneath it that turns red when it intersects with a comet.
      After some time, the 4 players are inflicted with [s:bind], preventing further movement as comets shoot out from the Dalamud symbol to their current location. If their tether was red-purple, they will instantly die. If their rectangle was red, the comet will explode, causing a [a:massive-explosion] that wipes the party. Any players (except for the baiters themselves) standing in the path of a comet will also instantly die. If both their rectangle and tether was resolved correctly, a comet will drop on their current position and [s:bind] will fall off.
      Be aware that, if the ends (the rounded parts) of two rectangles intersect, both rectangles will appear blue, but will then briefly flash red as the comets shoot out and cause a wipe anyway. This is because the comets aren't technically intersecting until they actually come out.
      During the [a:meteor-impact-cast] cast, the other 4 players also receive a tether and rectangle from a Dalamud symbol on the other side, but their comets won't shoot out until a few seconds after the first comets have resolved. Be aware that the last 4 players will have even less space available, due to the comets dropped by the first group. The second group also has much less time to move into their positions before being inflicted with [s:bind]. If the first group dropped their comets in inopportune places, the mechanic may not be resolvable for the second group. In this case, it is preferable to keep your tether short and thereby kill yourself, rather than hitting another comet and killing the whole party.
      The tethers will always target either all DPS or all supports, unless people are dead.
      After both groups' tethers are resolved, all comets explode in a large telegraphed [ms:chariot] AoE.
    resolve: |
      Stand close to the center of the arena, on [boss]'s hitbox ring. This will cause the proximity impacts to deal minimal damage.
      Next, you should settle on an order system for comets. Something like T1/T2/H1/H2 and D1/D2/D3/D4, for instance. This will determine where you drop your comet. There are generally only 4 viable placements per group, due to the angle of the comet trajectory – a player in group 2, for instance, may be able to squeeze their comet into a spot that a group 1 player wouldn't be able to reach as their comet would hit another comet.
      As group 1, always prioritize spots that only your group can feasibly reach, and make doubly sure the comet you're placing won't block a potential spot for a group 2 comet.
      As group 2, try to position yourself in-between two tethers close to the spot you're intending to go to. You can even stand inside one of the existing comets, since those are 100% guaranteed to be safe from the shooting comets. Alternatively, you can simply use [a:sprint].
      As either group, you cannot place your comet on the far other side (for instance, you cannot play your comet on the far west if you're part of the east group). This is due to the southern comet that is placed in-between the two Dalamud symbols, which you will hit in this case.
      Remember to move back to the hitbox ring after your comet is resolved, to avoid being in the path of the next set of comets or being in the enusing comet explosion.

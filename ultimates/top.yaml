    type: impairment
    duration: 180000
    description: |
      Reduces damage dealt by approximately 90%.
      Due to the extremely punishing nature of this debuff, great care should be taken to avoid it. If it cannot be avoided, consider killing yourself (for instance by stepping into the wall) and having a healer raise you afterwards, to reduce your damage down percentage from 90% to [s:43]'s 25%.
      **Do not do this in Phase 6, as this will erase your [s:brilliant-dynamis]/[s:spark-of-dynamis] buffs, making the rest of the phase unresolvable.**

    description: |
      A major mechanic revolving around towers and tethers.
      Inflicts the following effects:
      * 2 random players with [s:looper] (16s) and [s:first-in-line]
      * 2 random players with [s:looper] (25s) and [s:second-in-line]
      * 2 random players with [s:looper] (34s) and [s:third-in-line]
      * 2 random players with [s:looper] (43s) and [s:fourth-in-line]
      Then spawns two towers and two tethers originating from the boss and begins casting [a:blaster-cast]. The tethers can be passed between players by moving through them.
      Each tower must be soaked by exactly one player with the [s:looper] effect. Towers ignore players without this effect. Soaking a tower inflicts [s:twice-come-ruin] and resolves [s:looper] for that player; if [s:looper] is allowed to expire on its own, the player will be inflicted with [s:memory-loss] and likely [t:wall] themselves.
      The [a:blaster] tethers release a massive blast roughly the size of the boss's hitbox around the tethered players. The tethered players, as well as anyone else hit by the explosion, are inflicted with [s:hp-penalty] and [s:twice-come-ruin].
      This mechanic then repeats three more times. Note the following:
      * Tethers don't disappear after [a:blaster] resolves; they remain on whichever players last had them until the fourth set resolves.
      * The next set of towers spawns in a translucent state even before the current set has resolved.
      * There are, in total, 8 possible locations for towers to spawn (2 per cardinal, slightly offset from that cardinal to either side).
      * A tower cannot spawn in a location it has already spawned before. In some cases this allows you to predict where the next set of towers is going to spawn even before they appear.
      * Towers can never spawn on both positions of the same cardinal.
    resolve: |
      As each [s:twice-come-ruin] stack lasts for exactly 1 full turn of the mechanic, there is only one order to resolve the mechanic in:
      Turn 1: [s:first-in-line] soaks towers, [s:third-in-line] takes tethers and brings them to an empty cardinal.
      Turn 2: [s:second-in-line] soaks towers, [s:fourth-in-line] takes tethers and brings them to an empty cardinal.
      Turn 3: [s:third-in-line] soaks towers, [s:first-in-line] takes tethers and brings them to an empty cardinal.
      Turn 4: [s:fourth-in-line] soaks towers, [s:second-in-line] takes tethers and brings them to an empty cardinal.
      In other words: after resolving your tower or tether, you do nothing for a turn, then the next turn your role is whichever role you haven't had yet.
      Since there are always two players assigned to each mechanic, it is *strongly recommended* to use a priority system to determine who takes which tower/tether (and, in the case of tethers, where to bring that tether as well). If you're using Party Finder, check with your Data Center's Ultimate Discord to learn what priority system your Data Center uses. For example, LPDU (Light) uses M1/M2/MT/OT/R1/R2/H1/H2 where, if you are to the left of your partner in that list, you take the clockwise tower/tether starting from north, and if you are to the right of your partner in that list, you take the counter-clockwise tower/tether starting from north. As a result, M1 always goes clockwise no matter what, and H2 always goes counter-clockwise no matter what.
    tips:
      - If you forget which turn it is or what your job on this turn is, check your debuffs. If your [s:looper] debuff is about to expire, it's your turn to take a tower. If your "x in line" debuff and [s:looper] debuffs are gone and you have a [s:twice-come-ruin] stack that is about to expire or has already expired, it's your turn to take a tether. If your [s:hp-penalty] expires and you're suddenly on 1% HP, it's your turn to take a tower (unless [a:program-loop] has already concluded).
      - It is recommended to manually sort your party list so that the players you need to look at to determine your priority are at the very top. For example, using the LPDU priority described above, R1 would move the R2, H1, and H2 players to the top of their party list. If any of them have the same number, the R1 player would move clockwise; otherwise they would move counter-clockwise.
      - Taking your tether max melee in your designated empty cardinal is far enough to avoid hitting players on the tower cardinals, allowing you to keep full uptime on the boss.
      - After your tether is resolved, don't immediately beeline for the nearest tower cardinal. Instead, go slightly inside the hitbox so that any non-tether players can make their way past you, then wait until the next tether player has taken their tether from you before moving into a safe spot.
      - Never move directly through the center of the boss's hitbox, as you will likely steal someone else's tether and cause a wipe.
      - Since towers completely ignore players without [s:looper], after you resolve your tower, you can then stand in any tower you wish while waiting for your [s:twice-come-ruin] to expire.
      - Healers must heal the [s:third-in-line] and [s:fourth-in-line] players after their [s:hp-penalty] expires, as they'll die from [a:storage-violation] otherwise. Tanks can help by using targeted mitigation like [a:tbn] or [a:heart-of-corundum].
      - After the Program Loop cast, Omega does one more auto-attack before beginning the [a:blaster-cast] cast, at which point Omega's position and rotation is locked in for the remainder of the mechanic. It can be helpful to turn the boss to the southwest or southeast (depending on where your melees are in your priority order) before the [a:blaster-cast] cast begins, to give your melees easy access to positionals.

      Deals medium damage to the tethered players and all players in a large radius around them and inflicts [s:hp-penalty] and [s:twice-come-ruin].
      Be aware that [s:hp-penalty] reduces HP to triple digits only *after* the damage is dealt; if the players' HP reaches 0 from the initial hit, their HP won't be reduced to triple digits; they'll just die. However, in general it should not be necessary to heal these players before they take their hit unless there are significant gear problems or they forgot to eat food.

[a:ballistic-impact] resolves half a second later, and from then on spawns new puddles underneath each player every 2 seconds until the mechanic is complete as well.
      Additionally, the status effects on players will expire and execute their respective mechanic. [a:guided-missile-kyrios] is a spread [ms:chariot] that knocks any other players hit into the wall. [a:condensed-wave-cannon-kyrios] is a [ms:line] originating from Omega that must be shared with 3 other players to avoid dealing lethal damage.

      Like [a:program-loop], the debuff assignment is completely random and thus requires a priority system to handle. The flamethrower cones leave two safe spots for groups to assemble; each group must have only unique "x in line" debuffs amongst its members. As a caveat, both groups will likely be outside of the other group's healing range, so it's essential that each group features one healer. As such, a priority system like the following (LPDU) presents itself: MT/M1/R1/H1 for group 1, and OT/M2/R2/H2 for group 2 where, if duplicate "x in line" debuffs exist within the group, the leftmost member in this priority list swaps to the other group.
      As for where to place each group, it is most common to start group 1 north and group 2 south (or west/east) and rotate each group clockwise if the flamethrower cones happen to point directly north and south (or east/west).
      Like [a:program-loop], this mechanic has four turns. During each turn, the respective [s:guided-missile] player must separate from the group to take their [a:guided-missile-kyrios] alone, while the rest of the group must remain stacked to soak [a:condensed-wave-cannon-kyrios].
      There are two main ways of making this happen, see the strategies below.
    tips:
      - Avoid gapclosers or dashes. They make movement unpredictable and may cause you to drop a puddle in an inopportune location.
      - Due to how fast the mechanic moves, healers don't have the luxury of long-casting AoE heals here. However, there is no other healing-intense mechanic until Phase 3, so both the party and the healers should aim to use every single mitigation and healing cooldown they have during this mechanic.
      - When moving out for your [a:guided-missile-kyrios], consider using 
    strategies:
      chased:
        name: Chased
        common: true
        description: The group stays next to the [a:flame-thrower] that *chases* the group, while the [a:guided-missile-kyrios] baiter moves *deep inside* Omega's hitbox to get to the cone that moves *away* from the group. Moving inside the hitbox reduces the movement requirement and ensures that any puddles this player drops are not in the way of the rest of the group. After [a:guided-missile-kyrios] the baiter waits until their next puddle drop, then quickly moves back to the group.
      chasing:
        name: Chasing
        description: The group stays next to the [a:flame-thrower] that moves *away* from the group, while the [a:guided-missile-kyrios] baiter moves backwards slightly or simply waits in place until they've baited their [a:guided-missile-kyrios]. After baiting their missile, they move back up to the group through Omega's hitbox to reduce the movement requirement and avoid stepping into any puddles the group leaves behind.

    description: |
      Omega-M and Omega-F disappear and tether each player to another player, inflicting either [s:mid-glitch] or [s:remote-glitch] on all players, and show a matching PlayStation headmarker above all players and their partners.
      Omega-M and Omega-F then reappear, along with one *fake* clone for each that do nothing, and prepare a deadly AoE combination.
      The clones will always spawn in a line, with Omega-F on one side, a fake Omega-M in the center of the arena, Omega-M on the other side, and a fake Omega-F in a random location somewhere else. The true Omegas are always facing each other.
      Omega-M's and Omega-F's stances and weapons indicate which attack each will use:
      * Omega-F with a staff: a plus-shaped AoE originating from Omega-F ([a:optimized-blizzard-iii])
      * Omega-F with a stiletto feet: a safe line in the direction Omega-F is facing ([a:superliminal-steel])
      * Omega-M with a sword: a [ms:chariot] originating from Omega-M ([a:efficient-bladework])
      * Omega-F with a sword and shield: a [ms:dynamo] originating from Omega-M ([a:beyond-strength])
      While this is happening, a massive synthetic eye spawns on a random cardinal or intercardinal outside the arena. Some time after Omega-M and Omega-F have executed their respective AoEs, this eye will fire a deadly [a:optical-laser] line AoE through the center of the arena. At the same time, [a:optimized-fire-iii] (a [ms:chariot] [m:spread]) resolves on each player. This AoE is deadly if the correct distance between each tethered pair (defined by [s:mid-glitch] or [s:remote-glitch]) is not maintained.
      Finally, Omega-F appears in the center of the arena while 5 clones of Omega-M appear close to the edge of the arena. Two random players are marked with stacks, Omega-F executes a knockback from the center, and all Omega-Ms execute a large [ms:chariot] AoE from their position. There are always 3 Omega-Ms spawning directly beside one another, with a gap between every other Omega-M.
      If your party is still alive at this point, [s:mid-glitch]/[s:remote-glitch] expires, and the Omega-M that is sandwiched between the two other Omega-Ms, and the Omega-F in the center become targetable again and the next mechanical sequence commences.
    resolve: |
      While Party Synergy is casting, preposition yourselves into 2 [t:conga line]s (one per light party) or one big conga line for the whole party. There must always be 4 players per [a:optical-laser] side, and two tethered players cannot be on the same side, so if any tether pair is in the same group, one of them (usually the southmost one) adjusts to the other group.
      With groups settled, it now becomes time to identify Omega-F's and Omega-M's safe spot. To quickly distinguish the true Omegas from the fake ones, find the Omega-F and Omega-M who are facing each other, or simply find the Omega-F and Omega-M forming a direct line through the center of the arena.
      The following safe spots are possible:
      * staff + sword: stay away from Omega-M and Omega-F (be careful not to be on Omega-F's sides)
      * staff + shield: only Omega-M's sides are safe
      * stiletto feet + sword: only Omega-F is safe
      * stiletto feet + shield: only Omega-M is safe
      Note that there is not enough time to raise anyone, so if anyone dies during this step the mechanic is no longer resolvable and a wipe is all but guaranteed.
      While moving into the safe spot (or after moving into the safe spot), find the massive eye on the outside of the arena. This eye will be the new north for the duration of the mechanic. Note that the eye emits a directional sound when it spawns, which can make locating it easier.
      All group 1 players position themselves throughout the arena on the eye's left side (west), while all group 2 players position themselves throughout the arena on the eye's right side (east). Use the PlayStation headmarkers you received at the start of the mechanic to determine your final position. Most groups opt for (from closest to the eye to farthest from the eye): [i:cross][i:square][i:circle][i:triangle] (also known as BPOG – blue, purple, orange, green).
      Note that the positions must be adjusted based on [s:mid-glitch] or [s:remote-glitch].
      For [s:mid-glitch], stand close to but not right next to the [a:optical-laser] line. Note that the line is not telegraphed, so it is recommended to use arena markers to position yourself. For instance, with the standard LPDU markers, the correct distance is on the inside of the markers that are right next to [a:optical-laser] (see the diagram).
      For [s:remote-glitch], stand at the edge of the arena. Be aware that the tether must be stretched to almost the full diameter of the arena, which means group 2 must invert their positions if it's [s:remote-glitch] (so they would use [i:triangle][i:circle][i:square][i:cross] instead of [i:cross][i:square][i:circle][i:triangle]).
      Wait until the AoEs go off, then check both yourself and your partner to see if either of you have one of the stack markers. Each stack deals lethal damage if not taken with exactly 4 players, so equal groups must be reestablished – reestablished because it is not guaranteed that both stacks target players on opposite sides. If there are two stacks in the same group/side, one of them (usually the southmost one) **and their tether partner** must swap groups. This is why it is important to look at your partner. If there are two stacks per side and either you or your partner have the southmost one, both of you must swap sides.
      Identify the three Omega-Ms in a row and orient yourself toward them. If you're in group 1 and you're looking at the three side-by-side clones, you must always be knocked into the safe spot to your left. If you're in group 2, you must either be knocked back into the safe spot on your right (if it's [s:remote-glitch]) or the safe spot behind you (if it's [s:mid-glitch]). This knockback cannot be negated. There is, however, enough time after the knockback for slight position adjustments, so precision is not required here.

      Additionally, several clones spawn outside of the arena:
      * Two Omega-M clones spawn on opposite sides, each spawning a passable tether, and begin casting [a:optimized-bladedance]. On execution, these tethers resolve into massive 90° conal tankbusters.
      * One Omega-M clone spawns on a random position and begins casting [a:optimized-sagittarius-arrow], a baited [ms:line] AoE on a random party member. The position of this AoE snapshots at the start of the [a:optimized-sagittarius-arrow] cast.
      * One Omega-M clone that prepares a [a:synthetic-shield] and begins casting [a:beyond-defense] into [a:pile-pitch] once [a:optimized-bladedance] resolves.
      * One Omega-F clone that does nothing for now but begins casting [a:optimized-meteor] on 3 random party members once [a:optimized-bladedance] resolves.
      After all mechanics resolve, an Omega-M and Omega-F clone spawn behind Omega-F and command the eye to execute [a:cosmo-memory].
    resolve: |
      The party should preposition at [t:max melee] to the south of Omega-M. After the Limitless Synergy cast concludes, you once again have about 2-3 GCDs to cleave both bosses until Omega-F becomes invulnerable.
      Once tethers spawn, tanks should grab the tethers and move to the edge of the arena, slightly *clockwise* of their respective clone. If done correctly, the tankbusters leave a gap in the form of a narrow line through the center in which the party can stack.
      Consequently, after tanks have grabbed their tethers, the party should immediately move into the center of the arena, right on top of Omega-M. Do *not* wait for the [a:optimized-sagittarius-arrow] telegraph to appear as it has already snapshot its position.
      If the [a:optimized-sagittarius-arrow] clone spawned behind or in front of the party, the center may not be safe. In this case, wait for the telegraph to appear, then move slightly towards one of the two [a:optimized-bladedance] clones, just enough to get out of the AoE.
      Afterwards, two previously designated party members (usually the tanks) should move in-between the party and the Omega-M clone with the [a:synthetic-shield] at [t:max melee] to intercept [a:beyond-defense]. Whichever of these two players is targeted should immediately circle around the party, ending up on the opposite side so they cannot be targeted for or hit by [a:pile-pitch], which is lethal to that player. The other player should move in to stack with the party for [a:pile-pitch]. It is okay for the [a:beyond-defense] baiters to also be targeted for [a:optimized-meteor].
      The intended way to resolve [a:optimized-meteor] is to have these players move out of the [a:pile-pitch] party stack, but with sufficient shielding and mitigation the [a:optimized-meteor] players can just stack with the party. This has become the preferred way to handle this mechanic in most parties.
      Remember to heal up and mitigate for [a:cosmo-meteor], then it's just DPS until both bosses are dead.

      In addition, a telegraphed [ms:chariot] AoE appears underneath the boss's [s:superfluid] puddle, giving players time to move out of it before it goes into effect and becomes a **persistent death zone** for the rest of the transition that continuously emits [a:wave-repeater].
      3 mechanical hands spawn close to the outside of the arena, then another 3 hands spawn in-between them. Each hand emits a telegraphed [a:colossal-blow] about 12 seconds after it spawns.
    resolve: |
      The entire party should organize into a [t:conga line] to the south. Each Data Center's Party Finder may use a different line-up order, but the actual order makes no difference for the mechanic. LPDU uses R1/M1/MT/H1/H2/OT/M2/R2.
      Look at your debuffs. Once debuffs come out, take a step back if you get [s:sniper-cannon-fodder], take a step forward if you get [s:high-powered-sniper-cannon-fodder], and stay put if you get nothing. Wait until everyone there are 2 people in your new line (as nothing or [s:high-powered-sniper-cannon-fodder]) or 4 people (as [s:sniper-cannon-fodder]). Whichever position you are in this new line-up determines your position (see the diagram).
      Stay out of the first [a:colossal-blow], then step into both it and the preceding [a:wave-repeater] hit. The sniper cannons resolve at the same time as the second set of [a:colossal-blow], greatly limiting the available safe spots. This means that if anyone is out of position, there is no longer enough space to resolve the mechanic without deaths.

      Heavy raidwide that begins the next major mechanic.
      Please note that, while this mechanic is technically quite complicated, resolving it is actually quite simple. If reading all the technical specifications on how the mechanic works confuses you, try skipping to the "Resolve" section below.
      Inflicts the following debuffs on all players:
      * [s:local-code-smell] (2×23s, 2×44s, 2×65s, 2×86s)
      * [s:remote-code-smell] (2×23s, 2×44s, 2×65s, 2×86s)
      * [s:latent-synchronization-bug] (8×69s)
      The 2 [s:local-code-smell] players with a duration of 23s are also inflicted with [s:latent-defect].
      Also inflicts each of the following debuffs on 2 random players:
      * [s:overflow-code-smell] and either [s:underflow-code-smell] or [s:performance-code-smell]
      * [s:synchronization-code-smell] and either [s:performance-code-smell] or [s:underflow-code-smell]
      All of these gray debuffs are considered "inactive" and do not yet have an effect. After they expire, they turn into:
      * [s:local-code-smell] → [s:local-regression]
      * [s:remote-code-smell] → [s:remote-regression]
      * [s:overflow-code-smell] → [s:critical-overflow-bug]
      * [s:synchronization-code-smell] → [s:critical-synchronization-bug]
      * [s:underflow-code-smell] → [s:critical-underflow-bug]
      * [s:performance-code-smell] → [s:critical-performance-bug]
      Omega then spawns 4 towers (2 blue, 2 red) and begins casting [a:latent-defect]. At the end of the cast, all towers and critical bug debuffs resolve, causing a wipe if any towers are left unsoaked or any critical bugs are resolved incorrectly (more on how to resolve them correctly later). This is also where all 4 currently inactive tethers become active and can now break.
      Additionally, the blue towers inflict [s:latent-performance-defect] on all players inside, and the red towers [s:cascading-latent-defect]. Both are 10 second debuffs that resolve when [s:critical-performance-bug] and [s:critical-underflow-bug], respectively, expire. If a defect is allowed to expire on its own, the party wipes. In other words: if a player soaks a blue tower without [s:critical-performance-bug], or if a player soaks a red tower without [s:critical-underflow-bug], the party wipes 10 seconds later.
      In addition to (potentially) resolving [s:latent-performance-defect] or [s:cascading-latent-defect], each critical bug (if resolved correctly) turns into one of the following buffs:
      * [s:critical-overflow-bug] → [s:overflow-debugger]
      * [s:critical-synchronization-bug] → [s:synchronization-debugger]
      * [s:critical-underflow-bug] → [s:underflow-debugger]
      * [s:critical-performance-bug] → [s:performance-debugger]
      Each debugger renders the player immune to this type of critical bug for the remainder of the mechanic, even if they fulfill the conditions for being inflicted with it again.
      Omega repeats [a:latent-defect] 4 times, then casts [a:critical-error] at the end, a heavy raidwide that inflicts all players with all critical bugs again – unless they have the corresponding debugger. Critical bugs are only resolvable during [a:hello-world], so all players must have all 4 debuggers during [a:critical-error] or a wipe is guaranteed.
      Each critical bug can be passed to other players in some way:
      * [s:critical-overflow-bug]: a huge [ms:defamation] type AoE that inflicts [s:critical-overflow-bug] to anyone else hit by it.
      * [s:critical-synchronization-bug]: a small 2-man stack that inflicts [s:critical-synchronization-bug] to anyone else in the stack.
      * [s:critical-underflow-bug]: a [st:rot] that inflicts [s:critical-underflow-bug] to anyone coming into contact with this player. Explodes in a small AoE at the end of its duration.
      * [s:critical-performance-bug]: a [st:rot] that inflicts [s:critical-performance-bug] to anyone coming into contact with this player. Explodes in a small AoE at the end of its duration.
    resolve: |
      While the mechanic seems complicated, the debuffs applied at the start ensure that there is only one way to resolve the mechanic correctly.
      First, in this description, the following terms will be used instead of the full ability names:
      * [s:critical-overflow-bug] will be called "defamation".
      * [s:critical-synchronization-bug] will be called "stack".
      * [s:critical-underflow-bug] will be called "red rot".
      * [s:critical-performance-bug] will be called "blue rot".
      * [s:local-regression] will be called "red-green tether".
      * [s:remote-regression] will be called "blue tether".
      At the start of the mechanic, the party should position itself in a loose spread (ideally at clock spots) to avoid accidentally passing rots. Next, look at the party's debuffs and find a player with [s:critical-overflow-bug]. If that player has [s:critical-underflow-bug], *red* is the "[ms:defamation] colour". If that player has [s:critical-performance-bug], *blue* is the "[ms:defamation] colour". Remember this colour, as it doesn't change throughout the whole mechanic.
      The first red-green tether players always have [s:latent-defect], requiring them to be hit by [a:critical-overflow-bug] (defamation). Thus, the following order of operations establishes itself, which remains the same throughout all 4 [a:latent-defect]s:
      **Step 1:**
      * Red rots go to red towers.
      * Blue rots go to blue towers.
      * All tower players either stand at max melee if their tower is the defamation tower, or at the edge of their tower closest to the other tower if it isn't.
      * The blue tether players stand in-between the non-defamation towers, each stacking with one of the players inside those towers.
      * The red tether players each stand just outside of a defamation tower in-between a defamation tower and a non-defamation tower. Try to stand just outside the hitbox to avoid being clipped by the other defamation.
      **Step 2:**
      * [a:latent-defect] resolves.
      * Tower players get [s:synchronization-debugger] or [s:overflow-debugger].
      * Blue tether players get [s:critical-synchronization-bug] and red-green tether players get [s:critical-overflow-bug].
      **Step 3:**
      * Red-green tether players move on top of their respective tower players to receive their rot.
      * Blue tether players wait half a GCD for [s:magic-vuln] to expire, then move on top of their respective tower players to receive their rot. This automatically breaks their tether.
      * Red-green tether players wait a GCD or two for the blue tether's [s:stacking-magic-vuln:2] to expire, then move toward each other to break their own tether.
      * After this, make sure to **stay away from the previous tower players** as their rot will shortly explode and kill anyone nearby.
      These steps repeat for every [a:latent-defect]. However, the *last* [a:latent-defect] has a slight variation: instead of red-green tether players going to the defamation towers, they instead pretend they're blue tether players and stack on top of a blue tether player. This is because, at this point, both of these players should already have [s:overflow-debugger], so there is no reason to be hit by defamation again, and it makes more sense for these players to help soak the stack.
      If done correctly, all 8 players should have all 4 debuggers at the end of the mechanic.
    tips:
      - Each [a:latent-defect] set has 3 instances of heavy raidwide damage. Therefore, properly planning out your mitigation and healing is essential to survive this mechanic.
      - Outside of the [a:latent-defect] casts, the boss is constantly auto-attacking the main tank for over 30k damage per auto during the entire mechanic. There are no tankbusters until Phase 5, so make sure to use all your personal mitigation during this phase (except for your invuln). Off-tanks and healers should try to help the main tank as well. You may even want to consider a tankswap at some point during the mechanic.
      - It is very easy to accidentally pass rot while moving to your tower. To avoid this, rots should always move outside the hitbox, and tethers should always move inside the hitbox. Be aware of healers, who may have to go into the hitbox to heal (while also having rot).
      - Timing is extremely important during this mechanic. Rots must be passed within 1 or at most 2 GCDs of the towers resolving. If passed too early or too late, [s:cascading-latent-defect]/[s:latent-performance-defect] will expire, causing a wipe.
      - Timing is also extremely important for the tether breaks. Avoid breaking a tether while [s:magic-vuln] or [s:stacking-magic-vuln:2] is still active. It won't cause a wipe but will deal significantly increased damage which healers may not be prepared to heal.
    trivia: |
      This mechanic uses various programming terms for its submechanics, such as:
      * *Hello World*: a simple program that just prints "Hello World" to the console. One of the most common examples used to teach beginners the syntax of a new programming language.
      * *Code Smell*: any kind of code that is considered "bad" by modern programming standards, for instance by violating best practices. Can often result in subtle, hard-to-diagnose bugs.
      * *Overflow*/*underflow*: before storing a number in a variable, you have to first define the "size" of that variable (i.e. how big the numbers that you're storing in it can be). This size determines how much memory the variable takes up. If you try to store a too-large number in a too-small variable, the number *overflows* (meaning that it wraps back around to 0). *Underflow* is the opposite of that, when you try to store a too-small number in a too-small variable (for instance trying to store a negative value in a variable that can only store positive values).
      * *Debugger*: tool used to step through code one line at a time and inspect the values of each variable at runtime. Useful for diagnosing bugs.

      Heavy raidwide. Wipes the party unless a [i:tank] LB3 is used.
      Upgrades [s:quickening-dynamis:3] into [s:brilliant-dynamis] and gives [boss] [s:code-dynamis].
      Due to [s:brilliant-dynamis]'s (and [s:spark-of-dynamis]'s) damage resistance, it is required for all 8 players to have this buff at this point. If any players missed a stack of [s:quickening-dynamis] in Phase 5, it is no longer possible to finish the fight.
      [s:brilliant-dynamis] also gives a player the ability to use a limit break for free once the limit break bar is filled. Mechanically this phase requires:
      * 3× [i:tank] LB3 ([a:cosmo-memory-2] and [a:magic-number])
      * 2× [i:healer] LB3 ([a:magic-number])
      * 1× [i:caster] LB3 and 1× [i:pranged] LB3 ([a:cosmo-meteor])
      This leaves 3 possible [i:melee] LB3s for a total of 10 available limit breaks during this phase. As of patch 6.5, it is possible to skip one [i:melee] LB3 if your damage is good, but the others cannot currently be skipped as the DPS check is designed with 3 [i:melee] LB3s in mind.
      Other things to know include:
      * The [auto attacks](a:flash-gale) in this phase target the main target and the *farthest* target. [boss] always executes 2 auto-attacks in-between major mechanics, so after each major mechanic, it is essential that the party steps into the hitbox and the off-tank outside.
      * Due to the strict LB requirements, a non-standard [i:dps] composition (i.e. a party without a [i:caster] or [i:pranged], or a party without at least 2× [i:melee]) cannot finish the fight.
      * **Any death before [a:magic-number] is an automatic wipe** as that player loses their [s:brilliant-dynamis]/[s:spark-of-dynamis], meaning that even if raised they will just die again to the next damage instance. Unless you know what you're doing, do not take any risks during this phase.

      Use light party mitigation and light tank mitigation. You'll need your heavy mits for [a:wave-cannon-9].

      A circle with arrows appears on a random cardinal or intercardinal about half a second before the end of the cast. Three more circles then appear clockwise or counter-clockwise, each with a slight delay.
      Five seconds after the cast, big telegraphed AoEs spawn underneath each party member that resolve 2.7 seconds later. They do not follow players. More AoEs spawn underneath each party member every 2 seconds. At the same time, the first of the arrow circles on the outside of the arena resolves into exaflares that travel across the arena in the indicated direction, then the next, and so on.
    resolve: |
      Stack in the center of the arena with the entire party. During the cast, continuously turn your camera until you've found the location of the first exaflare. Once the cast finishes and the first set of AoEs appears underneath players, move toward the marker next to the first exaflare that does *not* have another exaflare on top of it, then move into where the first exaflare was, and continue to move around the hitbox at max melee until you're clear.
      Just like [a:pantokrator], don't move too far ahead – only move just outside the previous set of baited AoEs until the next set of baited AoEs appears.

      Annihilates the party. Can only be survived with a [i:tank] LB3, in which case the attack deals heavy damage and inflicts [s:magic-number] on all party members, a debuff that must be cleansed using [i:healer] LB3 within 6 seconds or the party wipes.
    trivia: |
      In programming terms, a *magic number* is a number that is used directly in source code. This is an anti-pattern; best practice is to extract such numbers into named constants and then reference the constant anywhere the number is needed. This way the name of that constant explains what the number means.
      For instance, if you saw an expression like "8 * 8760", you'd probably have no idea what this expression calculates. However, if you instead rewrite it as "8 * HOURS_PER_YEAR", now you know exactly that this expression calculates the number of hours in 8 years.

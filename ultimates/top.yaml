    description: |
      A major mechanic revolving around towers and tethers.
      Inflicts the following effects:
      * 2 random players with [s:looper] (16s) and [s:first-in-line]
      * 2 random players with [s:looper] (25s) and [s:second-in-line]
      * 2 random players with [s:looper] (34s) and [s:third-in-line]
      * 2 random players with [s:looper] (43s) and [s:fourth-in-line]
      Then spawns two towers and two tethers originating from the boss and begins casting [a:blaster-cast]. The tethers can be passed between players by moving through them.
      Each tower must be soaked by exactly one player with the [s:looper] effect. Towers ignore players without this effect. Soaking a tower inflicts [s:twice-come-ruin] and resolves [s:looper] for that player; if [s:looper] is allowed to expire on its own, the player will be inflicted with [s:memory-loss] and likely [t:wall] themselves.
      The [a:blaster] tethers release a massive blast roughly the size of the boss's hitbox around the tethered players. The tethered players, as well as anyone else hit by the explosion, are inflicted with [s:hp-penalty] and [s:twice-come-ruin].
      This mechanic then repeats three more times. Note the following:
      * Tethers don't disappear after [a:blaster] resolves; they remain on whichever players just received their blasts.
      * The next set of towers spawns in in a translucent state even before the current set has resolved.
      * There are, in total, 8 possible locations for towers to spawn (2 per cardinal, slightly offset from that cardinal to either side).
      * A tower cannot spawn in a location it has already spawned before. In some cases this allows you to predict where the next set of towers is going to spawn even before they appear.
      * On any given turn, both towers cannot spawn on the same cardinal.
    resolve: |
      As each [s:twice-come-ruin] stack lasts for exactly 1 full turn of the mechanic, there is only one order to resolve the mechanic in:
      Turn 1: [s:first-in-line] soaks towers, [s:third-in-line] takes tethers and brings them to an empty cardinal.
      Turn 2: [s:second-in-line] soaks towers, [s:fourth-in-line] takes tethers and brings them to an empty cardinal.
      Turn 3: [s:third-in-line] soaks towers, [s:first-in-line] takes tethers and brings them to an empty cardinal.
      Turn 4: [s:fourth-in-line] soaks towers, [s:second-in-line] takes tethers and brings them to an empty cardinal.
      In other words: after resolving your tower or tether, you do nothing for a turn, then the next turn your role is whichever role you haven't had yet.
      Since there are always two players assigned to each mechanic, it is *strongly recommended* to use a priority system to determine who takes which tower/tether (and, in the case of tethers, where to bring that tether as well). If you're using Party Finder, check with your Data Center's Ultimate Discord to learn what priority system your Data Center uses. For example, LPDU (Light) uses M1/M2/MT/OT/R1/R2/H1/H2 where, if you are to the left of your partner in that list, you take the clockwise tower/tether starting from north, and if you are to the right of your partner in that list, you take the counter-clockwise tower/tether starting from north. As a result, M1 always goes clockwise no matter what, and H2 always goes counter-clockwise no matter what.
    tips:
      - If you forget which turn it is or what your job on this turn is, check your debuffs. If your [s:looper] debuff is about to expire, it's your turn to take a tower. If your "x in line" debuff and [s:looper] debuffs are gone and you have a [s:twice-come-ruin] stack that is about to expire or has already expired, it's your turn to take a tether. If your [s:hp-penalty] expires and you're suddenly on 1% HP, it's your turn to take a tower (unless [a:program-loop] has already concluded).
      - It is recommended to manually sort your party list so that the players you need to look at to determine your priority are at the very top. For example, using the LPDU priority described above, R1 would move the R2, H1, and H2 players to the top of their party list. If any of them have the same number, the R1 player would move clockwise; otherwise they would move counter-clockwise.
      - Taking your tether max melee in your designated empty cardinal is far enough to avoid hitting players on the tower cardinals, allowing you to keep full uptime on the boss.
      - After your tether is resolved, don't immediately beeline for the nearest tower cardinal. Instead, go slightly inside the hitbox so that any non-tether players can make their way past you, then wait until the next tether player has taken their tether from you before moving into a safe spot.
      - ever move directly through the center of the boss's hitbox, as you will likely steal someone else's tether and cause a wipe.
      - Since towers completely ignore players without [s:looper], after you resolve your tower, you can then stand in any tower you wish while waiting for your next responsibility.
      - Healers must heal the [s:third-in-line] and [s:fourth-in-line] players after their [s:hp-penalty] expires, as they'll die from [a:storage-violation] otherwise. Tanks can help by using abilities like [a:tbn], [a:intervention], [a:heart-of-corundum], or [a:aurora].
      - After the Program Loop cast, Omega does one more auto-attack before beginning the [a:blaster-cast] cast, at which point Omega's position and rotation is locked in for the remainder of the mechanic. So, it can be helpful to turn the boss to the southwest or southeast (depending on where your melees are in your priority order) until the [a:blaster-cast] cast begins, to give your melees easy access to positionals.

      Deals medium damage to the tethered players and all players in a large radius around them and inflicts [s:hp-penalty] and [s:twice-come-ruin].
      Be aware that [s:hp-penalty] reduces HP to triple digits only *after* the damage is dealt; if the players' HP reaches 0 from the initial hit, their HP won't be reduced to triple digits; they'll just die. However, in general it should not be necessary to heal these players before they take their hit unless there are significant gear problems or they forgot to eat food.

      Randomly assigned to everyone by [a:pangenesis] at between 0-2 stacks. To avoid a wipe, each player must reduce their number of stacks to zero by the end of the mechanic. Stacks can be reduced by one by _merging_ with (i.e. standing close to) someone with a _lower_ number of stacks.
      Be aware that only 2s and 1s, and only 1s and 0s should merge. If a 2-stack merges with a 0-stack, the 2-stack becomes a 1-stack, but the 0-stack becomes a 1-stack as well, which is undesirable.
      There will always be 4 players with 2 stacks, 2 players with 1 stack, and 2 players with no stacks.
      Reducing your stack count for the first time inflicts [s:critical-factor].
    gameDescription: Subject to a factor that will cause explosive damage when this effect ends.

    description: |
      Chain symbols appear above all players. After roughly 5 seconds, all players receive a [s:missing-link] that tethers pairs of players together.
      The tethers will always pair a support with a DPS, unless players are dead.
      The chains can be broken through distance, but the distance required is relative to the starting distance between the two partners at the time that [s:missing-link] is applied. If both players are standing on top of each other at that point, the required distance to break the tether is approximately the full diameter of the miniature arena.
    resolve: All players should stack on top of each other in the center of the arena. Do *not* get baited by the chains appearing above players' heads; you **must** stay still until [s:missing-link] is applied. While waiting, identify the two positions on the edge of the arena that have no angel on or across from them. Once [s:missing-link] is applied, have all supports move to the safespot in the northwestern half of the arena, and all DPS to the safespot in the southeastern half of the arena (or vice-versa).

      This reflects the bright spots that appear at the top of the bubble when this ability is cast.

[boss] may spin the bubble in one of three ways; it is important to discern which way it will rotate as the AoEs will leave a lingering scorch effect wherever they rotate.
      If she lays a tentacle horizontally atop and below the bubble she will spin the bubble around its width axis, leaving only horizontal strips between the AoEs safe.
      If she lays a tentacle vertically atop and below bubble she will spin the bubble around its depth axis, leaving only vertical strips between the AoEs safe.
      If she lays two tentacles around the sides of the bubble she will spin the bubble around its height axis, leaving only a ring around the center safe.

      This ability is a reference to the classical elements earth, fire, air, and water. Notably, the mechanic itself uses Platonic solids (the collective name of the five convex, regular polyhedra) as stand-ins for these elements. Plato was a Greek philosopher who first associated each of these polyhedra with a particular element: fire with the tetrahedron, earth with the cube, air with the octahedron, and water with the icosahedron. With the notable absence of the octahedron, Plato's interpretation matches the polyhedra in the arena.

      4 players are assigned two stacks of [s:unstable-factor] and 2 players are assigned one stack of [s:unstable-factor]. Additionally, 2 of the 4 2-stack players are assigned [s:astral-tilt] and the other 2 [s:umbral-tilt]. Soon thereafter [a:pantheos] spawns two 2-person towers (dark on west and light on east), then four 2-person towers (light/dark on west and dark/light on east), then another four 2-person towers (light/dark on west and dark/light on east). All towers must be soaked by 2 players with either no tilt debuff or the opposite tilt debuff.
      After soaking a tower, one of the two soakers receives a corresponding tilt debuff, limiting the next tower they are able to take to the opposite polarity. The other soaker's tilt debuff (if they had one) falls off, allowing them to take any tower.
      The goal of this mechanic is to properly soak all towers while also reducing everyone's [s:unstable-factor] stacks to zero. Failing to do results in a wipe. [Unstable factor](s:unstable-factor) stacks can be reduced by merging with (i.e. standing close to) a player with less stacks (including zero). Reducing your number of stacks for the first time inflicts [s:critical-factor] and spawns a slime. After all towers have been soaked, all 6 slimes will tether to a random player before rushing toward them and executing [a:factor-in], an enormous Defamation-like explosion that inflicts lethal damage to anyone under the effect of [s:critical-factor].

    trivia: >
      The name refers to *ignoramus et ignorabimus*, a Latin maxim meaning "we do not know and will not know". In science this maxim is used to emphasize the idea that there are some things science will never be able to explain, regardless of the amount of research conducted. For [boss], however, you might interpret it a different way: Athena doesn't understand (and never will understand) why the party opposes her in creating her perfect paradise, hence why she gives up on trying to show them her new world and annihilates them instead.

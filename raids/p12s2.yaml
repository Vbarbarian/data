    description: |
      Heavy raidwide that initiates a major shape-based mechanic.
      12 polyhedra spawn in a 4x3 grid pattern within the arena: 4 red tetrahedra, 4 yellow cubes, and 4 blue icosahedra. After some time, each tetrahedron and cube attempts to *tether* itself to a neighbouring icosahedron. If successful, the shapes merge, wiping the raid. Players can prevent this by *intercepting* the tether before it appears. This causes the shape to tether itself to the player and merge with them instead, dealing medium damage to that player.
      Additionally, each player is assigned either [s:alpha] or [s:beta], shows a PlayStation icon above their head, and is tethered to another player ([s:shackled-together]), causing a wipe if the pair separates.
      The arrangement of the shapes is pseudo-random, but there are some guarantees:
      * There will never be more than 1 icosahedron per column.
      * Each icosahedron will be surrounded by at least 1 cube and 1 tetrahedron (but may be surrounded by more).
    resolve: |
      As there are 4 icosahedra and 4 pairs of players, each shackled pair should choose one icosahedron to "protect". The challenge of this mechanic, then, lies in figuring out which tetrahedron and which cube will tether to your designated icosahedron, as you must stand directly between that shape and the icosahedron to intercept the tether, and you must do so *before* the tether appears.
      If your icosahedron appears in a corner, this is a simple task; there are only two shapes neighbouring the corners, so there is no ambiguity. However, any other icosahedron may have 2 or even 3 different options on which shapes it may choose to tether to. Despite this, there is no randomness to the linking; each link can be 100% deterministically determined by checking the other shapes that surround the icosahedron and checking the possible options from *their* perspective.
      For instance, if you're designated to intercept the link between an icosahedron and one of two surrounding cubes, you will likely find that one of the cubes is next to two icosahedra, but that the other cube is next to *only your icosahedron* and therefore has no other option than to tether to that one.
      Note that while you *can* "YOLO" the mechanic, it is **strongly recommended** to use a deterministic shape assignment for your players. The [s:alpha] and [s:beta] status effects and PlayStation icons help with this and have no mechanical effect whatsoever. Since each column spawns exactly one icosahedron, you may use the PlayStation markers to assign columns to pairs (e.g. [i:cross][i:square][i:circle][i:triangle] for columns 1–4), and the statuses to determine which player within the pair intercepts which shape (e.g. [s:alpha] for tetrahedron, [s:beta] for cube).

    trivia: >
      This ability is a reference to the classical elements earth, fire, air, and water. Notably, the mechanic itself uses Platonic solids (the collective name of the five convex, regular polyhedra) as stand-ins for these elements. Plato was a Greek philosopher who first associated each of these polyhedra with a particular element: fire with the tetrahedron, earth with the cube, air with the octahedron, and water with the icosahedron. With the notable absence of the octahedron, Plato's interpretation matches the colours and names of the polyhedra in the arena.

    resolve: |
      While it is possible to "YOLO" this mechanic and just have players spread to an intercardinal relative to their tower that is closest to their initial spot while intercepting the tether, it is recommended to use a more deterministic strategy, for instance by using the [s:alpha] and [s:beta] markers to determine whether a player goes to the northmost or southmost spot to bait their cone within their column.
      If you're on the second or third column, make sure to stay close to the tower while baiting the cone to avoid getting clipped by a cone from the other side.
      After the first cone appears, move out of it.

      Major mechanic.
      At the start of the cast, a grid appears on the arena. Additionally, 2 players (1 support and 1 DPS) are marked with a beacon. At the end of the cast, **one** of them explodes for massive damage that can be shared in addition to raidwide damage to every party member.
      After the cast, 4 players (2 supports and 2 DPS) are assigned [s:pyrefaction] and 1 stack of [s:caloric]; these players are marked with a giant fire beacon above their heads. The other 4 players are assigned [s:atmosfaction] and 2 stacks of [s:caloric].
      [s:caloric]: During the entire mechanic, moving the length of the short side of two grid rectangles or moving the diagonal length of one grid rectangle adds one stack of [s:caloric] to that player. Reaching 5 stacks wipes the party.
      [s:pyrefaction]: A partner stack that must be shared by one other player or the party wipes. This also adds another stack of [s:caloric] to the source players (but not to anyone stacking with them).
      [s:atmosfaction]: A chariot that knocks back everyone who is hit by it, causing a wipe due to the resulting rapid accumulation of [s:caloric].
    trivia: The caloric theory is a debunked scientic theory that posed that heat comes from a unique fluid called the *caloric* which flows from hot to cold.
    resolve: |
      Regardless of what your strategy for this mechanic overall is, the initial beacon players must stack with at least one other person. Note that, since only one of them actually gets the stack, they can stack with each other.
      After this, movement becomes severely limited. All [s:atmosfaction] players must share one [a:pyre-pulse], while all [s:pyrefaction] players must share 2 [Pyre Pulses](a:pyre-pulse). This means that all players receive 3 stacks of [s:caloric] from those status effects alone, leaving them with only one single move for the entire mechanic.
      This does make it easy to think about the mechanic though. Basically, the rule is: if you haven't moved yet, your job is yet to come. If you *have* already moved, your job is done and you can sit back for the rest of the mechanic. It is out of your hands.
      To start with, the goal is to pair each [s:atmosfaction] player with one [s:pyrefaction] player, since [Pyrefactions](s:pyrefaction) can't stack with each other. Depending on the strategy you use, you may use either the [s:atmosfaction] players' one move here or the [s:pyrefaction] players'.
      Either way, once the first step of the mechanic is concluded and 2 more [Pyrefactions](s:pyrefaction) are assigned, the goal is to then pair the two players who now have nothing with the two players with [s:pyrefaction]. You have to do this away from the [s:atmosfaction] players as they will blow up at the same time.
      Once the mechanic is complete, **do not move until your stacks have disappeared.** After the last [a:pyre-pulse] it still takes several seconds for [s:caloric] stacks to expire.

      4 players are assigned two stacks of [s:unstable-factor] and 2 players are assigned one stack of [s:unstable-factor]. Additionally, 2 of the 4 2-stack players are assigned [s:astral-tilt] and the other 2 [s:umbral-tilt]. Soon thereafter [a:pantheos] spawns two 2-person towers (dark on west and light on east), then four 2-person towers (light/dark on west and dark/light on east), then another four 2-person towers (light/dark on west and dark/light on east). All towers must be soaked by 2 players with either no tilt debuff or the opposite tilt debuff.
      After soaking a tower, one of the two soakers receives a corresponding tilt debuff, limiting the next tower they are able to take to the opposite polarity. The other soaker's tilt debuff (if they had one) falls off, allowing them to take any tower.
      The goal of this mechanic is to properly soak all towers while also reducing everyone's [s:unstable-factor] stacks to zero. Failing to do results in a wipe. [Unstable factor](s:unstable-factor) stacks can be reduced by merging with (i.e. standing close to) a player with less stacks (including zero). Reducing your number of stacks for the first time inflicts [s:critical-factor] and spawns a slime. After all towers have been soaked, all 6 slimes will tether to a random player before rushing toward them and executing [a:factor-in], an enormous Defamation-like explosion that inflicts lethal damage to anyone under the effect of [s:critical-factor].

      *Pangenesis* is the name of Darwin's debunked theory on heredity, which postulates that the body is composed of tiny particles called *gemmules* that contain hereditary information. These gemmules are to gather in the reproductive organs and are passed onto offspring during reproduction.

      A 2-person dark tower spawns on the west while a 2-person light tower spawns on the east. This is followed by a set of two towers on each side: light and dark on the west, and dark and light on the east, followed by another set with the same constellation. Dark towers may not be taken by players with [s:astral-tilt] and light towers may not be taken by players with [s:umbral-tilt].

    trivia: >
      The name refers to *ignoramus et ignorabimus*, a Latin maxim meaning "we do not know and will not know". In science this maxim is used to emphasize the idea that there are some things science will never be able to explain, regardless of the amount of research conducted. For [boss], however, you might interpret it a different way: Athena doesn't understand (and never will understand) why the party opposes her in creating her perfect paradise, hence why she gives up on trying to show them her new world and annihilates them instead.

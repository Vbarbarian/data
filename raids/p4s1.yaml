description: Featuring mechanics with unforgiving snapshots that demand good team coordination and a quick eye, [fight] is one of the most dangerous first floor encounters the game has ever had. [boss]'s auto-attacks are physical, but its abilities feature a wide variety of magical and physical attacks. The fight also features a special Satiety Duty Gauge that gradually drains over the course of the fight, but you can essentially ignore it entirely.

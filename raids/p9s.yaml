description: |
  A variety encounter, as [boss] eats souls for breakfast, then adopts their aspects. While most of the fight revolves around simple AoE avoidance and stack/spread mechanics,
  [boss] executes a dangerous Limit Cut mechanic in the middle of the fight, one of the most lethal mechanics a first floor has ever had.
